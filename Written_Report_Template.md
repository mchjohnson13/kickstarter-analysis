# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to understand how the launch dates of different campaigns effected their outcomes.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and create visuals that depict the above information.

## Analysis and Challenges
There were no challenges in analyzing the data because all of the analysis was done using easy formulas in MS Excel. The biggest challange was understanding what needed to be done in GitHub.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
