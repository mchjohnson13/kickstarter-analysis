# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is a playwrite wanting to start a crowdfunding campaign. She has estimated a budget of over $10,000. She wants to gain an understanging of what factors make a successful campaign.

Specifically, Louise wants to understand if and how the launch dates and funding goals of different campaigns effected their outcomes.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and create visuals that depict the above referenced information.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
[Outcomes Based on Launch Date](./Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. There is a spike in successful outcomes within the Theatre category where the campaigns were started in the month of May which corresponds to the higher numbers of campaigns started in that month.
  2. The launch month with the least number of successful outcomes is December which also corresponds to the lowest number of campaign starts.
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  * The campaigns that had goals of less than $5,000 were more likely to have a successful outcome.
  * None of the campaigns in the "play" category were canceled.
  * One-third of the campaigns in the play subcatagory failed

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
