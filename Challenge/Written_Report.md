# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is a playwrite wanting to start a crowdfunding campaign. She has estimated a budget of over $10,000. She wants to gain an understanging of what factors make a successful campaign.

Specifically, Louise wants to understand if and how the launch dates and funding goals of different campaigns effected their outcomes.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and create visuals that depict the above referenced information.

## Analysis and Challenges
[Kickstarter Challenge Workbook](./Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Theatre campaigns based on launch month was charted to show the months with the highest number of successes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To visualize the effect of goal amounts on the outcomes of Play campaigns, set ranges of goal amounts were plotted against the percentage of successful and failed campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. There is a spike in successful outcomes within the Theatre category where the campaigns were started in the month of May which corresponds to the higher numbers of campaigns started in that month.
  2. The launch month with the least number of successful outcomes is December which also corresponds to the lowest number of campaign starts.
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  * The campaigns that had goals of less than $5,000 were more likely to have a successful outcome.
  * None of the campaigns in the "play" category were canceled.
  * One-third of the campaigns in the play subcatagory failed

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  * 
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  * Adding information on the rates of successful outcomes based on launch date and plotting that instead of the actual numbers gives an even better picture of what months are best to launch a campaign.
